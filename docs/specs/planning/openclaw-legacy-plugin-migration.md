# OpenClaw Legacy Plugin Migration

## Problem

Users who installed Signet before the OpenClaw plugin adapter shipped can stay
stuck on the legacy hook path forever. `signet sync` currently respects the
legacy config and never installs or activates the plugin runtime, so full
lifecycle capture remains silently disabled.

## Goals

1. Make the common upgrade path self-healing.
2. Keep the degraded legacy-only condition visible in diagnostics.
3. Add regression coverage so future sync changes do not reintroduce the trap.

## Proposed guardrails

1. `signet sync` upgrades legacy-only OpenClaw configs to the plugin path.
2. `signet doctor` warns when OpenClaw is still on the legacy-only path.
3. Sync output explains that the migration restored full lifecycle capture.
4. Tests cover legacy-only, plugin, and dual-runtime states.
